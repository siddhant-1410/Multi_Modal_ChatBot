I would suggest topical retinoids and benzoyl peroxide to help control the acne, and possibly oral antibiotics if the condition is more severe, additionally maintaining a good skincare routine and avoiding picking or squeezing the pimples can also help prevent further inflammation and scarring.",,2025-06-20 23:07:15.378502
